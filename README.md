# BMI-Calculator
Body Mass Calculator also known as the BMI calculator is used to calculate a person's weight and height, used as a simple method to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight.
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a value calculated from a person's weight and height, used as a simple method to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight.

To calculate BMI, divide your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

You can also use the following conversion formulas to calculate BMI if you have your weight in pounds and height in inches:

weight (kg) = weight (lb) / 2.2
height (m) = height (in) x 0.0254

BMI values are often used to categorize a person's weight status:

Below 18.5: Underweight
18.5 to 24.9: Normal weight
25 to 29.9: Overweight
30 or higher: Obese
It's important to note that BMI is just a rough estimate and may not be appropriate for all individuals, especially athletes, pregnant women, the elderly, and other populations with differing body compositions. Consult with a healthcare provider for a more accurate assessment of your body weight status.
